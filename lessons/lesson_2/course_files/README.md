# This is the excercise of lesson 2: deploy a DeepLearning model on a cloud platform or web service. In my case, I trained a bear identificator and I deployed it in HugginFace Spaces using gradio. 

Content of the files: 
1. bear-classificator-app.ipynb: notebook where the model is loaded from a .pkl file and the inference function, to be deployed, is defined. Also, it contains the lunching of the model. 
 
2. api-test-of-the-bear-prediction-model.ipynb: contains a test calling the bear predictor via de API.

3. export.pkl: saved model (the parameters and architecture of the NN). 

4. app.py: inference function used in file number 1.   

5. *.jp(e)g: images of bears of different breeds.
